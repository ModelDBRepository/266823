For the determination of R-input the cell (either passive or with tonicGABA) was manually loaded
in the GUI and then the Determine_Rinput rig was startet. 
This configuration allows the manual determination of current-induced voltage deflection,
from which R-input was calculated.

In this configuration als g_pas and g_tonic can be modified.

This configutation was used to mact R-input for both cell types.
